tModLoader generalizes modding and makes it easier for modders to create amazing mods.
As mentioned, it doesn't require you to work with the Terraria source code when creating the mod, so you don't have to learn all of its obscure intricacies.
This also saves you from having to decompile and recompile Terraria.exe. Additionally, you can create standalone mods that work well with other mods.
download the program and run tModLoader.exe
